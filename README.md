## The Challenge ![Experimental-Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Experimental-Conceptual-informational?style=flat&logo=""&logoColor=white&color=green)

Create a 2-D game where the player's avatar transforms based on a timer representing the time of day. Also, if the player is in possession of a magical totem, the avatar will have other transforming abilities. Use css keyframes to animate all sprites.

Another challenge is to create a _Block-Builder_ that allows the player to create new levels. The player will select from a color palette and drag the mouse over the screen, dropping colored boxes. Then when the player saves and loads the new level.

The _Level-Builder_ will simplify the blocks. This is done by reducing blocks that are similar in color and are adjacent to each other. The individual blocks will merge to form one large block. Each color also has it's own logic for use in the game (ie, green blocks are grass and the avatar cannot pass through them).

- add more complex levels with rewards
- use more refined animation for sprites
- make responsive and fix UI layout
